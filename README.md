# minion-python-rpi
This repo will host python3 scripts I've cooked up for my daughter, age 4, to play with on her RPI 1B (works on RPI 4 too)

## Structure and comments
* basicMath\math.py
  
  Program asks for addition questions where the sum is between 0 - 10 (max is 9).

## Languages
Current questions are in English, which I read to her. The plan is to translate the programs to Swedish and Russian
