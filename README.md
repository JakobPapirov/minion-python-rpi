Program asks for addition questions where the sum is between 0 - 10 (max is 9). First number is always 0 or 1.

## Languages
For programmatical and "source of Truth" reasons English will be the default language in which scripts will be written in.

All programmes are to be translated into Swedish and Russian over time.
