# minion-python-rpi
This repo will host python3 scripts I've cooked up for my daughter, age 4, to play with on her RPI 1B (works on RPI 4 too)

## Structure and comments
* math\math.py
  
  Program asks for addition questions where the sum is between 0 - 10 (max is 9).

## Languages
For programmatical and "source of Truth" reasons English will be the default language in which scripts will be written in.

All programmes are to be translated into Swedish and Russian over time.
